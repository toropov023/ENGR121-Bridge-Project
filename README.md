# ENGR121 Bridge Project

The bridge was constructed from popsicle sticks and a few 3D printed parts. The bridge was required to be built following a number of restrictions and guidelines. The bridge was controlled by an Arduino UNO with a custom built IO expansion board. The program is responsible for checking on-deck and marine traffic, switching lights and moving the deck. Check the video below to see the bridge in action.

## Design Criteria
* Span: total length must not exceed 150 cm.
* Width: must not exceed 75 cm from its centreline upstream or downstream.
* Height: must not exceed 60 cm above high tide water line.
* Bridge Deck Spacing: negligible gaps under car/pedestrian/bike lanes. Gaps  beneath the tramway must be less than 3 mm.
* Grade: must not exceed a grade of more than 3% at any point along bridge deck.
* Watercraft Clearance: must be a minimum of 20m wide at 40m high and 40m wide at the high tide line (between pier 1 and 2).
* Rail Traffic Clearance: rail must be more than 2 cm from edge of bridge deck. Must have  at least 5 cm between centre of the two tracks. * Height clearance must be at least 10 cm above bridge deck. (Overhead electrical guide must be included)
* Car Traffic Clearance: must have 2 cm between roadway and tramway. Must be no less than 5 cm height clearance along entire bridge over roadway. Two lanes required, at least 4 cm wide each.
* Pedestrian/Bicycle Traffic Clearance: must be at least 2 cm wide and must have a barrier and be 2 cm from tram/roadways. Must be a bike/pedestrian path on each outside edge of bridge deck.
* Load Bearing: must not deflect more that 0.5 cm under load. Must support 80 kg of distributed weight.
* Movement: max opening speed must be within 1.8 and 2.2 cm/s.
* Model Weight: total weight must not exceed 1.5 kg.
